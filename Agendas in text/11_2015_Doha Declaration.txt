		Draft Doha Declaration on integrating crime prevention and criminal justice into the wider United Nations agenda to address social and economic challenges and to promote the rule of law at the national and international levels, and public participation

	We, Heads of State and Government, Ministers and Representatives of Member States,
	Having assembled at the Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in Doha, from 12 to 19 April 2015, to reaffirm our shared commitment to uphold the rule of law and to prevent and counter crime in all its forms and manifestations, at the domestic and international levels, to ensure that our criminal justice systems are effective, fair, humane and accountable, to provide access to justice for all, to build effective, accountable, impartial and inclusive institutions at all levels, and to uphold the principle of human dignity and the universal observance and respect of all human rights and fundamental freedoms,
	To that end, declare the following:
	1.	We acknowledge the 60-year legacy and continuing significant role of the United Nations congresses on crime prevention and criminal justice as one of the largest and most diverse international forums for the exchange of views and experiences in research, law and policy and programme development between States, intergovernmental organizations and individual experts representing various professions and disciplines in order to identify emerging trends and issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice. We recognize the unique and important contributions of the congresses to law and policy development, as well as to the identification of emerging trends and issues in crime prevention and criminal justice. 
	2.	We reaffirm the cross-cutting nature of crime prevention and criminal justice issues and the consequent need to integrate those issues into the wider agenda of the United Nations in order to enhance system-wide coordination. We look forward to the future contributions of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with regard to designing and implementing national and international crime prevention and criminal justice policies and programmes, taking into account and building upon the recommendations of the congresses. 
	3.	We recognize the importance of effective, fair, humane and accountable crime prevention and criminal justice systems and the institutions comprising them as a central component of the rule of law. We commit ourselves to holistic and comprehensive approaches to countering crime, violence, corruption and terrorism in all their forms and manifestations, and to ensuring that those responses are implemented in a coordinated and coherent way, along with broader programmes or measures for social and economic development, poverty eradication, respect for cultural diversity, social peace and social inclusion. 
	4.	We acknowledge that sustainable development and the rule of law are strongly interrelated and mutually reinforcing. We therefore welcome the inclusive and transparent intergovernmental process for the post-2015 development agenda, which is aimed at developing global sustainable development goals to be agreed by the General Assembly, and acknowledge the proposals of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals as the main basis for integrating sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda, while recognizing that other inputs will also be considered. In this context, we reiterate the importance of promoting peaceful, corruption-free and inclusive societies for sustainable development, with a focus on a people-centred approach that provides access to justice for all and builds effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. 
	5.	We reaffirm our commitment and strong political will in support of effective, fair, humane and accountable criminal justice systems and the institutions comprising them, and encourage the effective participation and inclusion of all sectors of society, thus creating the conditions needed to advance the wider United Nations agenda, while respecting fully the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and recognizing the responsibility of Member States to uphold human dignity, all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in particular for those affected by crime and those who may be in contact with the criminal justice system, including vulnerable members of society, regardless of their status, who may be subject to multiple and aggravated forms of discrimination, and to prevent and counter crime motivated by intolerance or discrimination of any kind. To that end, we endeavour:
	(a)	To adopt comprehensive and inclusive national crime prevention and criminal justice policies and programmes that fully take into account evidence and other relevant factors, including the root causes of crime, as well as the conditions conducive to its occurrence, and, in accordance with our obligations under international law and taking into consideration relevant United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, to ensure appropriate training of officials entrusted with upholding the rule of law and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms;

We look forward to the results of the global study on children deprived of their liberty in this regard; 
	(f)	To mainstream a gender perspective into our criminal justice systems by developing and implementing national strategies and plans to promote the full protection of women and girls from all acts of violence, including gender-related killing of women and girls, in accordance with the obligations of parties under the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women7 and its Optional Protocol,8 and taking into account the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice9 and General Assembly resolutions on the gender-related killing of women and girls;

	(j)	To implement and enhance policies for prison inmates that focus on education, work, medical care, rehabilitation, social reintegration and the prevention of recidivism, and to consider the development and strengthening of policies to support the families of inmates, as well as to promote and encourage the use of alternatives to imprisonment, where appropriate, and to review or reform our restorative justice and other processes in support of successful reintegration;

	(p)	To conduct further research and gather data on crime victimization motivated by discrimination of any kind and to exchange experiences in and information on effective laws and policies that can prevent such crimes, bring perpetrators to justice and provide support to victims;

post-conflict situations, and to ensure accountability through the conduct of impartial, speedy and effective investigations, in accordance with national legislation and applicable international law;
	(t)	To strengthen the development and use of tools and methods aimed at increasing the availability and quality of statistical information and analytical studies on crime and criminal justice at the international level, in order to better measure and evaluate the impact of responses to crime and to enhance the effectiveness of crime prevention and criminal justice programmes at the national, regional and international levels.
	6.	We welcome the work of the open-ended intergovernmental expert group on the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and take note of the draft updated Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, as finalized by the expert group at its meeting held in Cape Town, South Africa, from 2 to 
5 March 2015, and look forward to the consideration of this revised draft, and action thereon, by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. 
	7.	We emphasize that education for all children and youth, including the eradication of illiteracy, is fundamental to the prevention of crime and corruption and to the promotion of a culture of lawfulness that supports the rule of law and human rights while respecting cultural identities. In this regard, we also stress the fundamental role of youth participation in crime prevention efforts. Therefore, we will endeavour: 
	(a)	To create a safe, positive and secure learning environment in schools, supported by the community, including by protecting children from all forms of violence, harassment, bullying, sexual abuse and drug abuse, in accordance with domestic laws;
	(b)	To integrate crime prevention, criminal justice and other rule-of-law aspects into our domestic educational systems;
	(c)	To integrate crime prevention and criminal justice strategies into all relevant social and economic policies and programmes, in particular those affecting youth, with a special emphasis on programmes focused on increasing educational and employment opportunities for youth and young adults; 
	(d)	To provide access to education for all, including technical and professional skills, as well as to promote lifelong learning skills for all. 
	8.	We endeavour to strengthen international cooperation as a cornerstone of our efforts to enhance crime prevention and ensure that our criminal justice systems are effective, fair, humane and accountable, and ultimately to prevent and counter all crimes. We encourage States parties to implement and make more effective use of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the 
three international drug control conventions and the international conventions and protocols related to countering terrorism, and urge all Member States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to those instruments. We underscore that any measures taken to counter terrorism must comply with all our obligations under international law. We endeavour to enhance further international cooperation to stop the systematic exploitation of large numbers of individuals who are forced and coerced into a life of abuse and degradation. We therefore strive:
	(a)	To promote and strengthen international and regional cooperation to further develop the capacity of national criminal justice systems, including through efforts to modernize and strengthen national legislation, as appropriate, as well as joint training and upgrading of the skills of our criminal justice officials, in particular to foster the development of strong and effective central authorities for international cooperation in criminal matters, inter alia, in the areas of extradition, mutual legal assistance, transfer of criminal proceedings and transfer of sentenced persons, and to conclude, where appropriate, bilateral and regional cooperation agreements, and to continue the development of specialized networks of law enforcement authorities, central authorities, prosecutors, judges, defence lawyers and legal aid providers to exchange information and share good practices and expertise, including, where appropriate, by promoting a global virtual network to advance, where possible, direct contact among competent authorities to enhance information-sharing and mutual legal assistance, making the best possible use of information and communication platforms;
	(b)	To continue to support the implementation of capacity-building programmes and training for criminal justice officials aimed at preventing and countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, in line with human rights and fundamental freedoms, including with regard to international cooperation in criminal matters, the financing of terrorism, the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes, the destruction of cultural heritage by terrorists and kidnapping for ransom or for the purpose of extortion, and at addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, and to cooperate, as well as address, further analyse and identify appropriate areas for joint action, through, inter alia, effective exchange of information and sharing of experiences and best practices, to counter any existing, growing or potential links, in some cases, between transnational organized crime, illicit drug-related activities, money-laundering and the financing of terrorism, in order to enhance criminal justice responses to those crimes;
	(c)	To adopt effective measures at the national and international levels aimed at preventing terrorist groups from benefiting from ransom payments;

of terrorist acts or in the supporting of terrorist acts is brought to justice, in compliance with obligations under international law, as well as applicable domestic law;
	(e)	To implement effective measures to detect, prevent and counter corruption, as well as the transfer abroad and laundering of assets derived 
from corruption, and to strengthen international cooperation and assistance to Member States to assist in the identification, freezing or seizure of such assets, as well as in their recovery and return, in accordance with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, in particular its chapter V, and in this regard to continue discussing innovative modalities to improve mutual legal assistance in order to speed up asset recovery proceedings and render them more successful, while also drawing on the experience and knowledge built through the implementation of the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime;
	(f)	To develop strategies to prevent and combat all illicit financial flows and emphasize the urgent need to adopt more effective measures to fight against economic and financial crimes, including fraud, as well as tax and corporate crimes, especially in their relevant transnational dimensions;
	(g)	To strengthen or, as appropriate, adopt procedures to more effectively prevent and counter money-laundering and enhance measures for the identification, tracing, freezing, seizure and recovery of the proceeds of crime, including money and other assets that have not been accounted for and that are found in safe havens, for the purpose of their eventual confiscation, including, where appropriate and in accordance with domestic law, non-conviction-based confiscation, and for the transparent disposition of confiscated proceeds;
	(h)	To develop and implement adequate mechanisms to manage and preserve the value and condition of frozen, seized or confiscated assets that are the proceeds of crime, as well as to strengthen international cooperation in criminal matters and to explore ways of affording one another similar cooperation in civil and administrative proceedings for confiscation purposes;

	(l)	To intensify our efforts to address the world drug problem, based upon the principle of common and shared responsibility and through a comprehensive and balanced approach, including through more effective bilateral, regional and international cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities, to counter the involvement of organized criminal groups in illicit drug production and trafficking and related criminal activities, and to take steps to reduce the violence that accompanies drug trafficking;

	9.	We endeavour to ensure that the benefits of economic, social and technological advancements become a positive force to enhance our efforts in preventing and countering new and emerging forms of crime. We recognize our 
responsibility to adequately respond to emerging and evolving threats posed by such crimes. Therefore, we strive: 
	(a)	To develop and implement comprehensive crime prevention and criminal justice responses, including strengthening of the capacities of our judiciary and law enforcement institutions, and to adopt, when necessary, legislative and administrative measures to effectively prevent and counter new, emerging and evolving forms of crime at the national, regional and international levels, taking into account the scope of application of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime with regard to “serious crimes”, in accordance with national legislation;
	(b)	To explore specific measures designed to create a secure and resilient cyberenvironment, to prevent and counter criminal activities carried out over the Internet, paying particular attention to identity theft, recruitment for the purpose of trafficking in persons and protecting children from online exploitation and abuse, to strengthen law enforcement cooperation at the national and international levels, including with the aim of identifying and protecting victims by, inter alia, removing child pornography, in particular child sexual abuse imagery, from the Internet, to enhance the security of computer networks and protect the integrity of relevant infrastructure, and to endeavour to provide long-term technical assistance and capacity-building to strengthen the ability of national authorities to deal with cybercrime, including the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of such crime in all its forms. In addition, we note the activities of the open-ended intergovernmental expert group to conduct a comprehensive study of the problem of cybercrime and responses to it by Member States, the international community and the private sector, and invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider recommending that the expert group continue, based on its work, to exchange information on national legislation, best practices, technical assistance and international cooperation, with a view to examining options to strengthen existing responses and to propose new national and international legal or other responses to cybercrime;
	(c)	To strengthen and implement comprehensive crime prevention and criminal justice responses to illicit trafficking in cultural property, for the purpose of providing the widest possible international cooperation to address such crime, to review and strengthen domestic legislation to counter trafficking in cultural property, where appropriate, in accordance with our commitments under international instruments, including, as appropriate, the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property17 of 1970, and taking into consideration the International Guidelines for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Responses with Respect to Trafficking in Cultural Property and Other Related Offences,18 to continue to gather and share information and statistical data on trafficking in cultural property, in particular on trafficking that involves organized criminal groups and terrorist organizations, and to further consider the potential utility of and improvements to the model treaty for the prevention of crimes that infringe on the cultural heritage of people in the form of movable property,19 and international standards and norms in this field, in close cooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the International Criminal Police Organization and other competent international organizations, with a view to ensuring coordination of efforts in fulfilment of their respective mandates;

These may include, as appropriate, smuggling of petroleum and its derivatives, trafficking in precious metals and stones, illegal mining, counterfeiting in trademark goods, trafficking in human organs, blood and tissue, and piracy and transnational organized crime committed at sea.21 
	10.	We support the development and implementation of consultative and participatory processes in crime prevention and criminal justice in order to engage all members of society, including those at risk of crime and victimization, to make our prevention efforts more effective and to galvanize public trust and confidence in criminal justice systems. We recognize our leading role and responsibility at all levels in developing and implementing crime prevention strategies and criminal justice policies at the national and subnational levels. We also recognize that, to enhance the effectiveness and fairness of such strategies, we should take measures to ensure the contribution of civil society, the private sector and academia, including the network of institutes of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, as well as the media and all other relevant stakeholders, in the development and implementation of crime prevention policies. Therefore, we endeavour:
	(a)	To plan and implement comprehensive policies and programmes that foster socioeconomic development, with a focus on the prevention of crime, including urban crime, and violence, and to support other Member States in such endeavours, in particular through the exchange of experience and relevant information on policies and programmes that have been successful in reducing crime and violence through social policies;

We therefore strive:
	(a)	To continue to provide sufficient, stable and predictable funding in support of the design and implementation of effective programmes to prevent and counter crime in all its forms and manifestations, upon the request of Member States and based on an assessment of their specific needs and priorities, in close collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime;
